#Context
In working on my Machine Learning final project, Jed and I pulled data from IMDB and a dataset with budget and gross movie information. This data is very rich and I wanted to explore with visualization. 

For this blog post I wanted to group actors into clusters based on genre, movie budget size and earnings ratios. For example, with this analysis I hope to identify groups of actors that are featured in big budget thrillers and distinguish from actors in romances. 

#Data & Code
We found a dataset with budget info [here](http://www.the-numbers.com/movie/budgets/). Using this data set, we made an api wrapper to get IMDB info about all of the movies, including genre, actor and other metadeta. After munging that data, I used two csvs for this project [1]() and [2]()

The initial dataset had a row for every movie and a few actors delimited by commas in another field. I had to un-pivot the data so that I had a row for every actor, the count of appearancees in a genre, and the average budget and earnings ratio per movie.

From here I ran k-means to cluster the data, and created a function to subset the data based on a genre and chart it. I found a function to add subplots to one plot. This came in handy as I couldn't do a facet grid because more often than not, a movie is classified as more than one genre. 

After I had the code setup to plot the top 12 genre subets colored by cluster, I experimented with the features in the algorithm and the k-means parameter. 

#Charts
I first tested 10 clusters with no transformations on the variables

Log transform of the average budget:

6 clusters, ER, log budget:

#Conclusion
will update this when I see all graphs in succession
